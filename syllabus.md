## CS/Ling 581 Computational Linguistics

Schedule #21841  
Spring 2015  
TuTh 9:30am-10:45pm  
Room LL-408



This course will serve as an introduction to the field of computational linguistics.

The course begins with an introduction to regular expressions and finite-state automata plus some basic natural language applications; this is extended to finite-state transducers with applications in phonology and morphology. Other topics covered: basic concepts of speech processing, the Viterbi algorithm, *n*-gram language models, part of speech tagging, context-free grammars and context-free parsing, and information retrieval.

### Instructor:

Phone: (619) 594-7111  

All course information, readings, assignments, slides, etc. will be available on the course website.

### Requirements:

The final grade will be based on homework assignments (30%), a take-home midterm exam (30%), and a take-home final exam (40%). Through the term, there will be occasional homework assignments to practice the techniques learned in class. Working on the homeworks in groups is encouraged, but please include the names of all coworkers on the assignment. The mid-term and final, though, should be done individually.  

If you are a student with a disability and believe you will need accommodations for this class, it is your responsibility to contact Student Disability Services at (619) 594-6473. To avoid any delay in the receipt of your accommodations, you should contact Student Disability Services as soon as possible. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive, and that I cannot provide accommodations based upon disability until I have received an accommodation letter from Student Disability Services. Your cooperation is appreciated.

Cheating and plagiarism in this course will not be tolerated.
